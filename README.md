### Introduction: 
FlocityClothingStore is an online clothing store where customers can view products and add items to their carts. Once added in the cart, we can see the transaction taking place as well. FlocityClothingStore is a Blazor MVC Web API, utilizing a software architecture known as n-tier. 
We are creating a complete Web Application in two parts - a Server application and a Client Application. We set up a .Net API(our server) that communicates with a front-end layer(client) that the user downloads and runs on their machine, locally using JavaScript. For this project, we are using Blazor components that are translated to JavaScript and HTML.
